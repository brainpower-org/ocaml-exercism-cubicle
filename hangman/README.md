# Hangman

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

[Hangman][] is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive
programs. It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of
saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write
"the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button
is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman using functional reactive
programming.  You'll need to install an FRP library for this, this will
be described in the language/track specific files of the exercise.

## Getting Started
For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml).

## Installation
To work on the exercises, you will need `Opam`, `Base` and `React`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instructions on how to install `opam` for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install base and react:

```bash
opam install base react
```

To run the tests you will need `OUnit`. Install it using `opam`:

```bash
opam install ounit
```

## Running Tests
A Makefile is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Interactive Shell
`utop` is a command line program which allows you to run Ocaml code interactively. The easiest way to install it is via opam:
```bash
opam install utop
```
Consult [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/ocaml](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Ocaml exercises.
